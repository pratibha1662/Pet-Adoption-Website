# Pet Adoption Website
[Project Link](https://pet-adoption-website-m7xh.onrender.com/)

A responsive and user-friendly MERN stack web application built to simplify and encourage pet adoption by connecting users with animals in need of homes. The platform displays a variety of adoptable pets with detailed information, allowing users to explore and discover pets by category and traits.

## Why I Built This

I created this platform to combine my interest in web development with a meaningful cause â€” helping animals find loving homes. It was also an opportunity to strengthen my skills in full-stack development using the MERN stack, from designing a clean user interface to building robust backend APIs and handling dynamic data with MongoDB.

### This website application provides the following functionality:

- Displays adoptable pets on the homepage with their names, images, and basic info.
- Allows users to explore pets based on categories such as dogs, cats, and other animals.
- Shows detailed traits and characteristics of each animal on a dedicated pet profile page.
- Fetches and displays pet data dynamically using RESTful APIs.
- Offers smooth navigation and a responsive user interface built with React.
- Connects to a MongoDB database to manage and retrieve pet records.
- Helps animal shelters or adoption centers list their pets online.
- Enables users to browse and choose pets they are interested in adopting.
- Can be expanded to include features like contact forms, adoption applications, or user logins in the future.
